We all know what currency is.  Whether it’s US Dollars, Euros, or Yen, we know that we earn money in the form of currency and then use it to buy goods and services.
However, nearly all major currencies in the world are created and managed by the local government or central banks.  Ie the US Government manages the US Dollar, the European Union manages the Euro, etc.
While we’d like to trust that our respective governments are not going to endlessly print money, what if we could take this power away from governments or corporations and use a currency where no one, not a single government or individual could ever print more or otherwise manipulate the currency.  
We can.  This is the power of bitcoin.
