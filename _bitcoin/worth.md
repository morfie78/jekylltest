As with any currency, the value of bitcoin is always changing.  Over time, more and more people have begun using bitcoin which has caused it to significantly increase in value.  However, to better understand the value of bitcoin, we must first ask: why do we value things differently?
Why do we perceive gold to be so incredibly valuable but dirt to be worthless?  The answer is scarcity.  Gold is rare and dirt is everywhere.  The more rare or scarce something is, the more value it has.  If everyone could suddenly turn straw into gold as in the classic fairy tale Rumpelstiltskin, eventually gold would be as worthless as straw.
Bitcoin is rare by design.  Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist and it is impossible to ever create more.  To put this in perspective, there are currently over one and a half trillion US dollars in circulation.  That is 73,333x more!
