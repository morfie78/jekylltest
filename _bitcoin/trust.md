Today, we still have to trust that the banks will keep our money safe and secure.  However, as we have seen in the past, banks do not always look out for our best interest (lol..bank puns).  The only alternative is to keep money in a safe or stuff it in the proverbial mattress.
However, while we certainly can take our money into our own hands, it is becoming increasingly difficult to actually use it in today’s connected society.  Whether paying our bills, buying products or services online, or sending it to a friend, we rely on banks to keep our money safe and process our transactions.
With Bitcoin, we no longer need to trust banks with our money while still being able to easily access our funds and pay for things online or in person.  We can eliminate bank fees, transaction fees, and pretty much all fees.  We can even ensure that our money is safe and secure without having to trust anyone.
We can take back control of our money.  This is the power of bitcoin.
